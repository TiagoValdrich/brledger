# BrLedger

BrLedger is a robust project, that attempts to create a Ledger to support Brazilian payments' operations,
such as Pix, Billet(also known as Boleto in Brazil) TED and TEV.

## About the project

This project is a personal project, that I'm developing to learn more about the Java language using Spring Framework and
Hexagonal Architecture(AKA Ports and Adapters).

The project still under development and there's a lot of work to do, but feel free to try it out
and contribute by opening issues and making suggestions.
